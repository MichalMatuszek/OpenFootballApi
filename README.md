OpenFootballApi 
by Joe Kampschmidt

An open source Football (soccer) data API via ServiceStack. I aim to create an API that could be used by anyone to track players, scores, and tags.

Uses ServiceStack.OrmLite https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite with SQLite.

Exposes the following endpoints:

- players
- tags
- playertags
